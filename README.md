# BarGraphicWithCanvas_HTML5
This widget offers following functions:
<ul>
  <li>When user opens up the current page, a crawling up animation will be applied on the bar graphic.</li>
  <li>All the users who are live on the site can see the changes of votes by having a ajax request keeps refreshing the page at the back</li>
  <li>Chart legend made by list.</li>
</ul>

The program language I've used on this small project: Javascript, Jquery, Ajax, PHP. <br/>
The Apache I'm using is XAMPP and backend database is phpMyAdmin.<br/>

I hope this can help a bit for those who are making a poll function on their websites.<br/> Welcome to any advise or ideas, please feel free to comment below.
